InfluxDB [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/influxdb/influxdb.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/influxdb/influxdb)
=========

InfluxDB is an open source distributed time series database with no external dependencies. It's useful for metrics, events, and analytics with a built in HTTP API so you don't have to write any server side code to get up and running. InfluxDB is designed to answer queries in real-time. That means every data point is indexed as it comes in and is immediately available in queries that should return in < 100ms. It's designed to be scalabe, simple to install and manage, and fast to get data in and out.
