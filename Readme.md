## Locking Server/PubSub/Service Discovery
  - GNats/Nats:
    - http://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1oqqx7/gnatsd_from_apcera_a_high_performance_nats_server/
    - NATS does not have persistence, or transactions. It is more like a nervous system, and it will protect itself at all costs and does not have SPOFs. It does publish/subscribe, and distributed queues.
    - http://www.quora.com/Cloud-Foundry/Why-does-CloudFoundry-use-NATS-a-specially-written-messaging-system-whereas-OpenStack-uses-AMQP
    AMQP, and implementations like RabbitMQ, are enterprise messaging systems built with things like durability, transactions, and formal queues. NATS was designed and built to be like a dial-tone publish-subscribe service, something that is always on and available. However, NATS does not provide durability or transactions, and its queuing model is interest-based only. It also protects itself, the NATS service, at all costs, so that it can always be available. This forms a great base platform for building scalable and reliable distributed systems, but is probably not a good fit for the typical enterprise application.

This repository is supposed to work with [DirEnv](https://github.com/zimbatm/direnv). It will set the GOPATH to current directory and append the ./bin folder to your PATH variable.
